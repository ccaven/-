The goals of this project are implementing these techniques with compute shaders:
1. Rotated FAST feature matching
2. Oriented BRIEF feature descriptors
3. Cross-frame feature matching
4. Local bundle adjustment

The bonus goals are to implement these techniques:
1. Loop closing via essential graph
